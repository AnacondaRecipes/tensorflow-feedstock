# UPDATING TENSORFLOW-FEEDSTOCK

We are moving back to using this feedstock as of tensorflow 2.17.0. Recipes for Tensorflow related conda packages for
tensorflow >1.8.0,<=2.12 can be found at https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/tensorflow_recipes

Although this isn't a fork of conda-forge's feedstock, it's a copy, with some changes to make it work for defaults. To
update this feedstock to the latest version of the conda-forge one, pull conda-forge's updates using your favourite git
mechanism, making sure that afterwards the changes from https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/tensorflow-feedstock/pull/1
are still applied.
